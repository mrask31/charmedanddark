# Phase-2 Guardrails & Non-Goals Specification

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Locked  
**Last Updated**: February 5, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

Phase-2 guardrails exist to prevent architectural drift and protect the foundational integrity of Charmed & Dark.

These guardrails prevent:
- **Trust erosion**: Features that manipulate, persuade, or optimize behavior
- **AI overreach**: Intelligence expansion beyond constrained, pre-defined boundaries
- **Conversion-driven manipulation**: Optimization that prioritizes metrics over integrity
- **Brand dilution**: Features that compromise calm, restraint, or separation of realms
- **Architectural drift**: Expansion that violates page-role doctrine or locked specifications

The system is stable, coherent, and production-safe. Phase-2 work must preserve this foundation.

## 2. Definition of Phase-2

### Phase-2 Is

Phase-2 work focuses on:
- **Refinement**: Improving clarity, consistency, and quality of existing features
- **Polish**: Visual refinement, typography, spacing, transitions
- **Consistency**: Aligning implementation with locked specifications
- **Atmosphere**: Deepening ambience within defined constraints
- **Operational hardening**: Performance, accessibility, error handling, testing

### Phase-2 Is Not

Phase-2 work does not include:
- **Feature expansion**: New capabilities, new pages, new user flows
- **Intelligence expansion**: AI learning, personalization, or inference beyond current scope
- **Personalization**: Dynamic content based on user data or behavior
- **Optimization**: Changes driven by conversion, engagement, or retention metrics
- **Behavioral tracking**: Analytics that inform persuasive design decisions
- **Reactive elements**: UI that responds to user input, presence, or emotion

### Boundary Statement

If a proposal introduces new behavior, intelligence, or pressure, it is not Phase-2 work.

## 4. AI Expansion Red Lines

### Where AI Is Permanently Forbidden

AI must never be used in:
- Commerce pages (product listings, product detail, checkout)
- Home page (invitation layer only)
- Post-purchase touchpoints (confirmation, email)
- Editorial content (context only, no generation)
- Navigation or wayfinding
- Pricing or inventory decisions

### Where AI May Only Operate (Constrained)

AI is permitted only in:
- **Mirror readings**: Single-turn response to user input, no learning, no memory
- **Narrative generation**: Product descriptions (pre-generated, reviewed, static)

AI in these contexts must:
- Operate within pre-defined templates
- Produce deterministic output for same input
- Never learn from user behavior
- Never personalize based on history
- Never infer emotion, intent, or desire beyond explicit input

### What AI Must Never Infer

AI must never infer:
- User emotion or mood (beyond explicit Mirror input)
- User intent or desire
- User needs or problems
- User personality or preferences
- User purchasing behavior or patterns
- User engagement or satisfaction
- User relationship status or life events

### AI Usage Statement

AI must never be used to increase conversion, urgency, or persuasion. AI must never optimize for engagement, retention, or revenue. AI must never simulate understanding, empathy, or relationship.

## 5. Conditions for Future Expansion (Not Commitments)

Expansion beyond Phase-2 may only be considered if all of the following conditions are met:

### Operational Stability

- System has operated without major incidents for 6+ months
- Performance metrics are stable and acceptable
- Error rates are below defined thresholds
- Accessibility compliance is verified and maintained

### Proven Trust

- Customer feedback indicates trust is maintained
- No complaints about manipulation or pressure
- Post-purchase satisfaction is high
- Sanctuary usage is voluntary and sustained

### User-Initiated Demand

- Demand is explicit, not inferred from metrics
- Demand is consistent across multiple channels
- Demand does not compromise existing doctrine
- Demand is for deepening, not expansion

### No Compromise to Doctrine

- Proposed expansion does not violate page-role boundaries
- Proposed expansion does not introduce persuasion or optimization
- Proposed expansion does not expand AI intelligence or personalization
- Proposed expansion aligns with locked specifications

### Conditions Statement

Meeting these conditions does not guarantee expansion will occur. These are necessary conditions, not sufficient conditions. Expansion remains optional and must be justified independently.

This section does not promise future features. It defines minimum requirements for consideration only.

## 6. Deepening vs Expanding (Decision Test)

Future contributors must apply this test to any proposed change:

### Deepening

Deepening improves clarity, quality, or calm within existing boundaries.

Examples of deepening:
- Refining typography for better readability
- Improving color contrast for accessibility
- Smoothing transitions for reduced motion
- Clarifying copy for better understanding
- Optimizing performance for faster load times
- Adding error handling for edge cases
- Improving test coverage for existing features

Deepening does not introduce new behavior, intelligence, or pressure.

### Expanding

Expanding introduces new behavior, intelligence, or pressure beyond existing boundaries.

Examples of expanding:
- Adding new AI capabilities or inference
- Introducing personalization or dynamic content
- Creating new user flows or pages
- Adding reactive elements or optimization
- Introducing engagement metrics or tracking
- Creating new touchpoints or notifications
- Adding social features or gamification

Expanding is not permitted in Phase-2.

### Decision Test

Ask: Does this proposal introduce new behavior, intelligence, or pressure?
- **Yes** → Expanding → Reject
- **No** → Deepening → Evaluate against specifications

Ask: Does this proposal optimize for conversion, engagement, or retention?
- **Yes** → Expanding → Reject
- **No** → Deepening → Evaluate against specifications

Ask: Does this proposal violate any locked specification?
- **Yes** → Reject
- **No** → Evaluate for quality and necessity

If uncertain, default to rejection.

## Enforcement

This specification is locked. Any proposed change that violates these guardrails must be rejected.

If a proposal's classification is unclear, default to rejection.

If a proposal requires expansion, it is not Phase-2 work.

Phase-2 work may deepen the system, but must not expand its behavioral surface area.
